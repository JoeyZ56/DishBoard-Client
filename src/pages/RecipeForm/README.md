### Things to change:

Currently the "Servings size" only allows numbers e.g. 500 service error if a user puts "2-4" (change to a string)

create a drop down for quantity and units to make it easier on the user for form input

Make suggestions for tags to help coral users into picking predetermined tags for easier search.

attach the image that is already in the recipe for update recipe so user doesnt have to regather the information.
