RecipeDetail.jsx Component Structure:

1. Imports

    React + hooks (useEffect, useState)

    useParams from react-router-dom

    Axios or fetch for API calls

    MUI components for layout/styling

2. Main Component Function

    Grab id from route using useParams()

    Define state to hold the recipe object (e.g., const [recipe, setRecipe] = useState(null))

3. useEffect

    Fetch recipe details from backend using id

    Handle loading/error states as needed

    Store data in state

4. UI with MUI

    Use MUI components like Card, Typography, Grid, etc. to display:

        * Title

        * Image (if any)
        
        * Ingredients

        * Instructions

        * Any extra metadata (prep time, servings, tags, etc.)

Step-by-Step Thinking Guide: 

1. Get the id from the URL

    You're using react-router-dom—what hook lets you pull dynamic parts of the route?

2.  State Setup

    What kind of data structure is a recipe? Think about what default state value makes sense before it’s loaded.

3. Data Fetch

    How do you trigger a fetch only once when the component loads?

    What’s the dependency array look like?

    Where does the fetch go—inside or outside of the hook?

4. Rendering Logic

    What should the user see before the data loads?

    What about if there’s an error or the fetch fails?

5. Display with MUI

    Break the recipe object down: title, description, ingredients, etc.

    Think layout: Grid? Card? How do you want it to feel?

    Do you need to map over any arrays inside the recipe?
